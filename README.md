# CO-column
Column density of interstellar carbon monoxide from gas temperature

Code to obtain the total column density of CO (or any interstellar molecule) from the fit to the rotation diagram.
Written as an astrophysics teaching tool, using data from the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database

index.php (above) has the code for an online interface for the most commonly detected interstellar molecules
